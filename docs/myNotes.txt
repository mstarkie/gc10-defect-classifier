A label is the correct answer you want the model to predict. 
The defect classification ('crease', 'oil_spot', etc.)

TRAINING:
Labels are used to compute how far off the model's predictions are (loss), so the model can learn.

EVALUATION:
During evaluation: Labels are compared to predictions to compute accuracy, precision, etc.

Create the training data:
Two arrays sorted by image file name.  
imgs_train = the image file jpeg paths sorted by image name
xmls_train = Just the image file names sorted by image name
labels     = The set of all the classifications taken from the pathnames in the imgs_train array

/// set up pandas data frame based on the list of labels ///

Create a 2D data frame of the classification indecies from the labels list and their associated one-hot class vector
Create the label dataset, a tuple consisting of [224 x 224 x 3] array of pixes and the classification
Take 80% of the dataset to use as training and 20% to test
