#VGG16 architecture, a popular convolutional neural network used for image classification.
base_vgg16 was trained on ImageNet, which has 1.2 million images and 1,000 categories. It has already learned to extract:

Edges
Textures
Shapes
Object parts (eyes, wheels, feathers, etc.)

Imagine you're learning to recognize submarines. It's easier if you've already studied cars, planes, and ships. You start with general pattern recognition and adapt it to your specific task â€” that's what base_vgg16 gives you.
